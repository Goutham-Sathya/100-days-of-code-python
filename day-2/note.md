# Day 2 Notes ðŸ§ 

## âœ… What I Learned:
- How to **store values** in variables.
- How to use **`int()`** and **`float()`** to convert input types.
- Did **basic math operations**: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`
- Used `round()` to control decimal places.
- Started combining everything in a **real mini-project** (tip calculator ðŸ’¡).

## ðŸ”¢ Type Conversion

`input()` always gives a string â€” so to do math, you have to convert:

```python
age = input("How old are you?")
age_in_10_years = int(age) + 10
